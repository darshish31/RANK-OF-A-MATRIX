# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the numpy library.
### Step 2: Define the matrix as a 2D array.
### Step 3: Use numpy.linalg.matrix_rank() to compute the rank of the matrix.
### Step 4: Print the computed rank.
## Program:
```
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by:Darshini B
#RegisterNumber:24008783

import numpy as np
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [3, 6, 9]])
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)
print(rank)

```
## Output:
